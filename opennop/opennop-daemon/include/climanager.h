    OpenNOP is an open source Linux based network accelerator designed 
    to optimise network traffic over point-to-point, partially-meshed and 
    full-meshed IP networks.

    OpenNOP-SoloWAN is an enhanced version of the Open Network Optimization
    Platform (OpenNOP) developed to add it deduplication capabilities using
    a modern dictionary based compression algorithm.

    SoloWAN is a project of the Center for Open Middleware (COM) of Universidad
    Politecnica de Madrid which aims to experiment with open-source based WAN
    optimization solutions.
